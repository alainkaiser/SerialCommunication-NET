Using socat to Create Virtual Serial Ports on macOS

This guide explains how to create virtual serial ports on macOS using socat. These virtual ports can be used for testing serial communication in your applications.

Prerequisites:
- Homebrew (for installing socat if not already installed)

Installation
- Install socat using Homebrew:
   `brew install socat`
- Creating Virtual Serial Ports
    `socat -d -d pty,raw,echo=0 pty,raw,echo=0`
- The command will output the names of the two created virtual serial ports.
- Adjust the permissions of the virtual serial ports to allow your user to access them:
    `sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttys002 /dev/ttys003`
- Open one terminal window and connect to the first virtual serial port:
    `screen /dev/ttys002 9600`
- Open another terminal window and connect to the second virtual serial port:
    `screen /dev/ttys003 9600`
